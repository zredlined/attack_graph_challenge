# attack_graph_challenge
This project provides a dataset of simulated cybersecurity scenarios designed for training autonomous AI agents using Reinforcement Learning. The core task is a descriptive, tool-based intrusion challenge where an agent must learn to traverse a network's attack graph to achieve a final objective.
